### The OGame Bot for Android ###
All the serious players use OGame bots to keep their account safe while they are offline so why shouldn't you?

So far there was no alternative to the OgameAutomizer App for Computers which charges a monthly fee and is only available for Computers.

DMB is a completely free and open source alternative. Created by Ogame players for Ogame players!

**Please note that the project is in its pre alpha stage.**

### LibOGame ###

To interface with ogame servers, DMB uses libogame, a sub-project included in the Dark Matter Bot project that handles all interactions between the ogame website and the DMB Android App.
The LibOGame part of the code is written and maintained compatible with oracle java to facilitate easy porting of DMB to Desktop Computers in the near future so you may better
utilize its power on whichever platform you prefer.
